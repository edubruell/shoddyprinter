Description: Ever wondered how your beautiful ggplot look when printed out by a journal editor? 
    'The Editor's Shoddy Printer' lets you preview how your pristine plots will inevitably look when downgraded 
    to grayscale, filled with random blotches, low-contrast text, and other delightful imperfections. 
    This package adds random printing artifacts, burnout areas, and simulates low-quality black-and-white printing. 
    Why fight it? Embrace the chaos.
